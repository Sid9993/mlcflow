## How to Become a Contributor

We value all contributions, whether they are code, documentation, bug reports, or feature suggestions. If you contribute **more than 50 lines of code** (including tests and documentation), you will be officially recognized as a project contributor.  

**Note:** Trivial contributions, such as minor typo fixes or small formatting changes, will not count toward the 50-line threshold.  

To contribute:  
1. **Fork** the repository.  
2. **Create** a new branch for your feature or bug fix.  
3. **Submit** a pull request (PR) describing your changes.
